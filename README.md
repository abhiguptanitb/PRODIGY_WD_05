ðŸ”¢ Project : Build a Weather App
ðŸ“Œ Task No. : 05

I've developed a weather app as part of my internship, and I can't wait to share the details with you all! The app fetches weather data from a reliable weather API, allowing users to get the current weather conditions based on their location or any user-inputted location. 

# Features

1. Location-Based Weather Data: Automatically fetches the weather data based on the user's current location.

2. User-Inputted Location: Allows users to input any location to get the current weather details for that area.

3. Current Weather Conditions: Displays real-time weather conditions such as sunny, cloudy, rainy, etc.

4. Additional Information: Provides other relevant information like humidity, wind speed.

# Technologies Used

1. Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

2. API Integration: Fetching data from OpenWeatherMap API.
